Box2DUtil

Some utilities for Box2D I created when developing Cow Trouble. Box2DUtil.h contains functions for converting to/from Box2D space, and CollisionUtil.h/cpp contains some functions and classes to simplify raycasting operations, and includes code for swept shape collision queries. This was last tested with Box2D v2.1.2, so I'm not sure yet if it works with the newer versions.
